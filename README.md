# hello_flutter

This is my first _Flutter_ application.
This application will greet you, change its color 
randomly after touch at any place of the screen 
and notify you with a SnackBar.

The app is created with _Android Studio_, so you can download it
and run with a virtual device or install on your phone.
Also, it's possible to download a built .apk file and install the app with it.
